      When you join meetings through Amie, we'll automatically record them. If you join them through eg. Google Calendar, we'll automatically ask you to start recording the call. We'll also auto-stop the recording.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want Amie to work fully in the background, you can enable fully-automatic recordings. This will record every call without you having to do anything.

      <p>
        Take notes in private, before or during the meeting. We'll then use those raw notes as focus points for the summary. You can define the headings we should use. List out key numbers as emphasis. Or use it to prepare the agenda.

      <p class="mt-4">
        Private notes taking in the dedicated tab are not visible to anyone else. This makes them great for time-based notetaking.
