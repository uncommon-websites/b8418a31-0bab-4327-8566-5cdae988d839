    "prompt": "A modern, softly lit interior space with a subtle, pixelated gradient grid pattern on a wall, transitioning from mint green at the top to teal at the bottom. The environment is viewed straight-on, with natural daylight streaming in, and the overall atmosphere is calm and inviting. There are no text, screens, posters, or abstract elementsâ€”only real objects such as plants, furniture, and people casually interacting or relaxing in the space. The grid pattern appears as part of the wall decor, not overpowering, allowing for visual balance and variation in each scene.",
